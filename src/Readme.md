# README: Semester break learning

### What I did:

I spent my semester break learning Java as preparation for my next course, Object-Oriented Programming. 
I found that the best way to learn Java was to code along while I was learning. 
This helped me to better understand the flow of the language and to apply what I was learning in real time.

### What I learned:

I learned the **basics** of the Java programming language, including:

- Variables and data types
- Operators
- Control flow statements
- Functions
- Classes and objects
- Object-Oriented Programming Concept (OOP)

---
OOP concept consists of five:
1. Classes and Instances
2. Inheritance
3. Abstraction
4. Encapsulation
5. Polymorphism

---
I also learned about some of the more **advanced features** of Java, such as:

Generics
Exception handling
Multithreading

---
**How I feel:**

Overall, I am very satisfied with what I learned during my semester break (July-Early Oct 2023). 
I feel confident that I am prepared for my next course, Object-Oriented Programming. 
I am also excited to continue learning Java and to build more complex applications.

Tips:

Here are some tips for learning Java:

1. Start with the basics. Make sure you understand the basic concepts of programming, such as variables, 
data types, operators, and control flow statements.

2. Code along while you learn. This is the best way to apply what you are learning and 
to understand the flow of the language.

3. Practice regularly. The more you code, the better you will become at it.

4. Find a mentor or study group. Having someone to help you learn and to answer your questions can be very helpful.
